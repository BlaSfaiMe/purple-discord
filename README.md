Advanced Options
----------------
**Use status message as in-game info**: If enabled, the status message set via
Pidgin (the text under Available, Away, etc in the buddy list) will be
used as the game info for Discord "Playing ...".

**Auto-create rooms on buddy list**: If enabled, the plugin will add the
channels (rooms) from the servers you're on as chats on your buddy list.
This is preferred if you're using Pidgin, so you don't need to access
the room list manually. If you're not using Pidgin (or finch), you
probably don't want this, since they have different buddy list APIs.
Note: If the room list changes, it won't recreate the list unless you
delete the entire group.

**Number of users in a large channel**: Mention behaviour is "smart" in
here. If you're in a small channel, every time a message is sent, you'll
be notified and the channel will pop up. If you're in a large channel,
you'll only be notified if you're explicitly mentioned in the message.
This value is the threshold to define a large channel. By default, if
there are more than 80 (online) users in the channel, it will be
considered large.

**Maximum number of backlog messages to fetch**: If messages were sent in a
room while you were offline, by default they will be retrieved and displayed.
For performance reasons, the number displayed is limited, by default to 100.
This limit controls the number displayed. Set to 0 to display backlog entirely.
